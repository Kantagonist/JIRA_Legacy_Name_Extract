# JIRA Legacy name creator

This is a small tampermonkey script, which allows the user to autogenerate two things.

* branch name with <ticket-number>_<ticket-name>
* commit message

The latter looks like 

\[<ticket-number>\] <ticket-name>


\{\}

It only works on older legacy systems, but can serve as basis for future scripts
